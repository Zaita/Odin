The threat of someone gaining access to a low-priority system, then leveraging that internal access to break into a high-priority system (i.e. lateral movement) must be avoided.</p><p>Your deliverable is required to undertake or provide a recently completed penetration test for the service you're using. If you're adding new APIs (etc) to an existing API management platform please provide a recent penetration test (less than 12 months old). If none can be found, or does not exist, you will be required to undertake a penetration test of this service to validate it's security rating.</p><p>Penetration test findings that are Medium or higher in the penetration test will be required to be remediated in line with the Agencies position on risk. Please ensure you have documented remediation evidence and attestations from the vendor that all appropriate remediation work has been completed.</p><p>If you're assessing an external vendor. Please provide a copy of their latest penetration test report and remediation response. If you're assessing an internal product, please use an approved penetration test vendor to complete this work. If you do not know of an approved vendor, please contact <a href=\"mailto:security.architects@example.co.nz\">security.architects@example.co.nz.</a></p>",

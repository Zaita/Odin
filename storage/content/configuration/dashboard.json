  "titleText": "<p>Odin is a web application self-service entry point for a quality assurance lifecycle process. This tool collects relevant information about a delivery, determines the risk rating and generates the appropriate requirements. The tool tailors the list of requirements to the projects specific needs, without providing unnecessary unrelated requirements. The process is derived from a <br>security centric perspective, allowing the security teams and non-security stakeholders (e.g., privacy, data, finance) to establish custom guidance and requirements as checklist items for all deliveries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Odin is used as a guide and reference for deliverying high quality outcomes, be they software release or entire projects. This encourages a security mindset among project teams and can be used to easily track the completion of requirements for the project. Odin is a no-code solution, allowing quick and easy deployment of workflows that support organisational delivery processes. You can be up and running in a few minutes with the pre-configured work-flows.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Odin comes pre-configured with:</p>\n<p>- Basic workflows to illustrate common scenarios including tasks covering basic concerns like privacy, security and data management</p>\n<p>- Customisable approval flows with delegations</p>\n<p>- Digital security risk assessment and control validation audit capability</p>\n<p>- Usage Reporting&nbsp;</p>",

# The Odin
Odin, previously the Security Development Lifecycle Tool, is a web application tool that serves that massively simplifies your change management process. Odin is a self-service entry point for a dynamic work-flow based quality assurance lifecycle process. This tool collects relevant information about a delivery, determines the risk rating and generates the appropriate requirements. The tool tailors the list of requirements to the projects specific needs, without providing unnecessary or unrelated requirements. The process is derived from a security centric perspective, allowing the security team and other stakeholders (e.g., privacy, data, finance) to establish custom guidance and requirements as checklist items for all deliveries.

Odin will allocate tasks to a change submission, allowing all aspects of the change requirements to be managed from within the platform itself. Odin is used as a guide and reference for deliverying high quality outcomes, be they software release or entire projects. This encourages a security mindset among project teams and can be used to easily track the completion of requirements for the project.

The Odin is a no-code solution, allowing quick and easy deployment of workflows that support organisational delivery processes. You can be up and running in a few minutes with the pre-configured work-flows.

The tool comes pre-configured with:
- Basic workflows to illustrate common scenarios
- Tasks covering basic concerns like privacy, security and data management
- Built in approval flows with delegation ability
- Digital security risk assessment capability
- Control validation audit capability
- Certification and accreditation capability
- Service inventory module for certification and accreditation
- Usage Reporting

## Odin's Origin
Odin was derived from ideas and concepts I developed while working for the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA/Waka Kotahi) for the SDLT. Odin is completely separate and new, with no direct compatibility to the SDLT.
